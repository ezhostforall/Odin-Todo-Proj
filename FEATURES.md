### âœ… **Enhanced Dashboard**

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**

### **Navigation Flow**
1. **Dashboard** â†’ Shows all projects in a grid
2. **Click "View Project"** â†’ Navigates to project detail page
3. **Project View** â†’ Detailed view with task management
4. **Click "Back to Dashboard"** â†’ Returns to dashboard
5. **Header "Dashboard"** â†’ Quick navigation back to dashboard

### **Task Management Flow**
1. **Add Task**: Fill form â†’ Submit â†’ Task appears in list
2. **Complete Task**: Check checkbox â†’ Task moves to completed section
3. **Edit Task**: Click edit button (TODO: implement editing modal)
4. **Delete Task**: Click delete â†’ Confirmation â†’ Task removed

### **Project Selection**
- When you click "View Project", that project becomes the "selected" project
- The selected project is used throughout the app for task operations
- State is maintained when navigating between views

## ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Improvements**

### **Project View Features**
- Clean header with project stats (total, completed, remaining tasks)
- Organized sections: Add Task form at top, Tasks below

- Proper form validation
- Success feedback messages
- Clear and reset functionality

### **Task Display**

- Completed tasks are visually distinct (crossed out, faded)

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Features**

- Automatic persistence of all changes
- Proper error handling and validation

### **Component Architecture**
- Reusable components with clear responsibilities
- Proper event handling and cleanup

### **Data Flow**
